    - [x] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** In addition to showcasing the above features, for ease of grading, please show yourself refreshing the featured page more than once. 
  - [x] Application includes a navigation bar or some other mechanism such that users can navigate to the page with all playlists from the featured page and vice versa without using the browser's back and forward buttons.

      - **Note:** You will not be graded on the implementation of this optional subfeature to keep your grade of this stretch feature independent of your implementation of other stretch features.

## Reflection

**Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment?**  
Yes, the weekly labs on DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with JSON data directly mapped to the core requirements of this project. Building modals in Lab 3 helped me implement the playlist detail pop-ups. The array methods we practiced in Lab 4 made the shuffle feature straightforward, and Lab 5‚Äôs work on form handling was invaluable when I added the ‚ÄúNew Playlist‚Äù and ‚ÄúEdit Playlist‚Äù forms.  
*Features that felt less familiar*: I hadn‚Äôt previously fetched data from a third-party API in class, so integrating the iTunes Search API for 30-second previews took some extra research.  

**If you had more time, what would you have done differently?**  
- **Persistent storage:** Integrate `localStorage` (or a back-end) so playlists, likes, additions/edits/deletions survive page reloads.  
- **Drag-and-drop reordering:** Allow users to reorder songs within a playlist by dragging.  
- **Better error handling:** Show a user-friendly message if the iTunes API lookup fails or returns no preview.  
- **UI polish:** Add smoother animations (e.g. Fade-in modal) and nicer custom controls for the audio player.  

**Reflect on your project demo, what went well?**  
- The demo of adding, editing, and deleting playlists went smoothly; peers could immediately see how the grid updates in real time.  
- The shuffle button reliably rearranged songs in the modal.  
- I did run into one hiccup when switching between the ‚ÄúAll Playlists‚Äù and ‚ÄúFeatured Playlist‚Äù pages‚Äîthe search controls weren‚Äôt present on Featured‚Äîbut catching and guarding those elements taught me to write more robust, page-aware code.
